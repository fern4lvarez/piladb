**piladb** is a lightweight RESTful database engine based on [stack data structures](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29).
Create as many stacks as you need, `PUSH` or `POP` elements of any kind, and have
access to the one on top always in constant time.

Features
--------

* Stacks are auto-scalable and are only limited by the capacity of the host
  or by configuration.
* Available `POP`, `PUSH`, `PEEK`,`SIZE`, and `FLUSH` operations for each of the stacks.
* Manage stacks and other resources by using a REST API, so you can use it with
  your favorite programming language.
* Manage elements in JSON-compatible data types: strings, numbers, arrays, objects, etc.
* Totally configurable using a REST API, or CLI parameters.
* In-memory store.
* Written in Go, i.e. binaries are self-contained and distributable.

Documentation
-------------

* [Main documentation page](http://docs.piladb.org).
* [Go `pila` package documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/fern4lvarez/piladb/pila).
* [`pilad`'s RESTful API documentation](pilad/).

Install
-------

You can download binaries for Linux and Mac in the
[**Releases**](https://github.com/fern4lvarez/piladb/releases/latest)
page.

### From Source Code

> You need Go installed. Version 1.6+ recommended.

```bash
go get github.com/fern4lvarez/piladb/...
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fern4lvarez/piladb
make pilad
```

Clients
-------

* shell: https://github.com/oscillatingworks/piladb-sh:

  ```
  source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscillatingworks/piladb-sh/master/piladb.sh)
  piladb_help
  ```

Development
-----------

> You need Go installed. Version 1.6+ recommended.

```bash
go get github.com/fern4lvarez/piladb/...
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fern4lvarez/piladb
make all
```

You can also use Docker to create `piladb` builds or development environment.
Please see the [`dev`](dev/) directory.

Dependencies
------------

**piladb** aims to minimize the amount of third party dependencies and to rely on
the Go standard library as much as possible.

Even though, it uses [`gvt`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt) to vendor its few
dependencies. If you use Go 1.6+, or Go 1.5 with `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` set,
you're good to go, libraries in `vendor` directory will be used and everything will
work as expected. You don't need to install, use or understand `gvt`.

If you are using a lower Go version, **piladb** will use either your current local
version of the dependencies, or the latest one available. Things might break, so
please consider updating to the latest version.

Code Coverage
-------------

We aim for a universal 100% code coverage for all suppackages. If some
piece of code is not testable, it probably needs to be changed.

Check current code coverage of the project: https://codecov.io/gh/fern4lvarez/piladb

Release
-------

> You need Docker installed.

It's possible to get `pilad` binary releases by executing `make release`.
This will cross-compile `pilad` in all available OS's and architectures.

Alternatively, if you don't have docker installed, you can release `pilad` binary
with the `make gox` command. For this, you need a configured Go environment and
[`gox`](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox) installed.
